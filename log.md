# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 21, 2019 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Solved all the Arrays and Linked Lists problems in Hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: It went well as I was able to recall lots of things that I have learnt before in college DS class. The recursive method of printing the linked list in reverse and Cycle detection using fast and slow pointers were interesting. 

Stuff which I would like to revise again later:
1. [Merging of two sorted linked lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/), 
2. [Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-a-sorted-linked-list/)
