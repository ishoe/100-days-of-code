# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 21, 2019 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Solved all the Arrays and Linked Lists problems in Hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: It went well as it was basic stuff and I have learnt it before in college. The recursive method of printing the linked list in reverse and merging two sorted lists were interesting. Stuff which I would like to revise again later: [Merging of two sorted linked lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/)
