# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 20, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Solved all the Arrays and Linked Lists problems in Hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: It went well as I was able to recall lots of things that I have learnt before in college DS class. The recursive method of printing the linked list in reverse and Cycle detection using fast and slow pointers were interesting. In the end first day was a success.

Revise again later:
1. [Merging of two sorted linked lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/), 
2. [Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-a-sorted-linked-list/) 
2. [Reversing Doubly Linked List](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reverse-a-doubly-linked-list/problem)

### Day 2: January 21, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Solved few Trees and Stacks problems in Hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: So I solved a bunch of problems on Trees and Stacks. I found trees bit weird. I need to get better at it. Stacks was fun to solve. 

In finding *height of binary tree* it was interesting to note that if you want to count the edges till the leaf then return -1 in terminating condition or if you are counting the nodes itself then return 0. Clean and short code using recursion is used quite a lot in trees. For *level order traversal* we used queues. 

Problems in stacks were pretty straight forward. 

Revise again later:
1. [Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/binary-search-tree-lowest-common-ancestor/problem)
2. [Swap Algo]()
3. [Game of Two Stacks]()
4. [Waiter]()
